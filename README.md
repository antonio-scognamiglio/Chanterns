It is an iPad game that aims to entertain and help people interested in learning Chinese. The main idea behind this game is `ChengYu`, which are common Chinese idiomatic expressions composed of 4 characters. 
The player's goal is to discover the meaning behind these ChengYu by completing the different levels.

The main technology used in this app is `SwiftUI` and `animations`. The biggest challenge was coordinating all the animations and implementing the various controls.
